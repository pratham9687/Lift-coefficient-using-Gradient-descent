Here cl_cl0_gradient_descent.py contains the code to analyze CL(AOA) and CL0. 
A linear relation is considered between AOA and CL so the code derives CL/AOA and CL0. 
The lift coefficient model is considered as CL = CL_a * AOA + CL0.  
Controller_data is the file that contains real flight test data. 
log_number is the file that has the file containing which flight data to choose from multiple controller data.
In this repo 7th test flight data is provided as example.
